# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
 
  Lousie wanted to know how other campaigns like hers did when compared to their launch date and funding goals. 

### Purpose
  
   To see if her campaign did better than the others in the same time frame. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  May and June had the highest amount of successful campaigns while November and December had the lowest.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  
   In relation to goals the data seems to show the best campaign goal mark to be set at between 30000-34999. This creates best odds at for the highest goal value.
   If looking for best possible outcome regardless of value then the data shows that 25000-29999 is the benchmark to set as it yeilded 100% success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   
  The biggest challenges I faced were in the countifs portion of the project. Making sure the right values were placed in the right locations and that the outcomes were correct
  was very challenging at the end of a long work day and after putting the children to bed. Attention to details is critical in ensuring the outcome is correct.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  Two conclusions one can draw from the outcomes based on launch date are that if you want to have the highest chance of success launch in May or June and if you are seeking the least chance 
  of success launch in November or December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  
  The highest percentage of success was between the 25000-29999 range if one is looking for the best outcome that would be the goal to set for your campaign

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

   The data set is limited by not expanding on what is above the 50000 cap or below the 1000 limit by not exploring these we only see a broad view however if we were to break those areas down further
   we could get an even more granular view of what went on in the camapigns and how they faired in the funding. The way the funds were attempted to be raised is also not disclosed which limits the data 
   as well. If we could understand how the funds were being requested we might be able to explain why some campaigns faired better than others as well. 
 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    Some other tables or graphs that could be created could be campaign succes by country of origin, This would allow the viewer to see if one country faired better than another
    in successfully funding the campaigns.
